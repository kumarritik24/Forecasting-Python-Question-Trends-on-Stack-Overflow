# 📈 Stack Overflow Python Trends Forecasting

📊 This project analyzes and forecasts trends in Python-related questions on Stack Overflow from 2008 to 2024. It applies time series forecasting methods like Holt-Winters and ARIMA to uncover usage patterns and predict future trends.

---

## 🧠 Objective

> 📌 **Forecasting Question**  
How will the number of Python-related questions on Stack Overflow trend in the coming years?

> 🎯 **Why it matters**  
Understanding these trends helps tech educators, curriculum designers, and businesses adapt to shifting developer interest and platform demand.

## 📦 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Stack Overflow dataset (monthly question counts from 2008 to 2024)
- **Granularity**: Monthly format (`YYYY-MM`)
- **Focus**: Python-related tags only
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Converted to datetime format
  - Filtered and resampled into univariate time series

## 🔮 Forecasting Models Applied

<details>
  <summary>🧠 Models Used</summary>

- Naive Forecast
- ETS (Exponential Smoothing)
- ARIMA
- Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>📏 Accuracy Metrics</summary>

- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MSE / MAE / MAPE
- Residual diagnostics: independence, randomness, and autocorrelation

</details>

## 🧪 Results & Insights

- **Forecast Output**:  
  Python-related questions are expected to stabilize or slightly decline post-2024

- **Best Performing Model**:  
  Holt-Winters – due to lowest error metrics and clean residuals

## 💼 Implications

> **Recommendation**  
Tech stakeholders should be aware of Python’s saturation point and consider diversifying content or offerings.

> **Next Steps**  
Use job market, GitHub activity, and global events to build multivariate forecasting models in future.
