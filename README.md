## **Deliverables**

### 1. **Forecasting Question**
- **Question**: How will the number of Python-related questions on Stack Overflow trend in the coming years?
- **Importance**: Understanding these trends helps stakeholders optimize resources, plan curriculum, and strategize for the evolving tech landscape.

---

### 2. **Data Description**
- **Source**: Stack Overflow dataset containing monthly question counts for various programming languages from 2008 to 2024.
- **Key Features**:
  - `Month`: Date in MM-DD-YYYY format.
  - `Python`: Monthly count of Python-related questions.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Converted `Month` to Date format.
  - Focused on Python data and created a univariate time series for analysis.

---

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Trends and Patterns**:
  - Significant growth in Python-related questions from 2008 to 2021.
  - Decline in activity observed from 2021 to 2024.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Time series plots showcasing trends and patterns.

### 4. **Forecasting Methods and Residual Analysis**
- **Models Used**:
  - NA√èVE
  - Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
  - Holt-Winters
  - ARIMA
- **Residual Analysis**:
  - Evaluated residuals for randomness and independence using diagnostic plots.

---

### 5. **Accuracy Measures**
- **Metrics Used**:
  - ME (Mean Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MPE (Mean Percentage Error)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
  - MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)
  - ACF1 (Autocorrelation at Lag 1)
- **Importance**:
  - These metrics were used to select the most accurate and reliable forecasting model.

---

### 6. **Forecast Results and Accuracy Summary**
- **Predicted Trends**:
  - Python-related questions are predicted to stabilize or slightly decline post-2024.
- **Model Comparison**:
  - Holt-Winters achieved the best performance with the lowest RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
- **Chosen Model**:
  - Holt-Winters was selected for its superior accuracy and residual diagnostics.

---

### 7. **Decision Based on Analysis**
- **Interpretation**:
  - Holt-Winters forecasts predict a stabilization in Python-related questions.
- **Implications**:
  - Businesses and educators should prepare for plateauing Python demand and consider diversifying their offerings.
